prevampire is a package made to work in supplementary with the vampire package (LINK HERE). This package contains methods that expedite the user's preparation for the VAMPIRE pipeline, and limits the amount of code interaction needed for someone new to python. 

The package was made to turn raw tif images of microglia into numpy arrays so that the vampire package could be applied succesfully. This package also applies and outputs skeletonization on the images after thresholding. 

The VAMPIRE package returns a dataframe containing characteristics of each microglia identified within the dataset and return average shape modes. 

Cell morphology is used as a support to show the effectivity of nanotherapudics or impact of brain diseases.
